## Running the Doc Site

First install all dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Next, run the server:

```
npm run server
```

This will optimize the icons, create a JSON file with all the icon path data, and start up a development server with live reload capabilities.

This task also watches for changes and rebuilds the JSON file whenever icons are added or edited, automatically reloading your browser to display changes as they come in.
